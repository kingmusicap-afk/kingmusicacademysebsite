# King Music Academy Website - Design Approach

## Design Philosophy: "Prestige Meets Accessibility"

The website must communicate **professional excellence** (befitting an M.S.K. recipient and national icon) while remaining **warm and inviting** (reflecting the academy's mission to make music accessible to everyone).

### Core Design Principles

1. **Regal Minimalism**: Use the deep royal blue and silver/white palette sparingly but powerfully. Avoid clutter; let whitespace and typography do the heavy lifting.
2. **Typography as Hierarchy**: Employ a bold, distinctive display font for headlines (conveying prestige) paired with a clean, readable body font (ensuring accessibility).
3. **Depth & Subtle Motion**: Use soft shadows, gentle gradients, and smooth transitions to create a sense of polish and professionalism without feeling cold.
4. **Founder-Centric**: The founder's image and credentials must be visually prominent—this is the academy's greatest asset.
5. **Clear Call-to-Action**: The enrollment form must be easily discoverable and frictionless, positioned strategically to capture intent.

### Visual Style

- **Color Palette**:
  - Primary: Deep Royal Blue (#003D7A or similar)
  - Secondary: Silver/White (#F5F5F5, #FFFFFF)
  - Accent: Gold (#D4AF37) - used sparingly for emphasis
  - Neutral: Charcoal (#1A1A1A) for text

- **Typography**:
  - Display Font: A bold, elegant serif (e.g., Playfair Display) for headlines—conveys prestige and authority.
  - Body Font: A clean, modern sans-serif (e.g., Poppins or Raleway) for body text—ensures readability and accessibility.

- **Layout**:
  - Hero Section: Full-width, asymmetric layout with the founder's image on one side and the hook/CTA on the other.
  - Content Sections: Alternating left-right layouts to create visual rhythm and avoid monotony.
  - Enrollment Section: Prominent, centered, with a clear form and visual hierarchy.

### Sections to Build

1. **Hero**: The Royal Standard hook, founder image, and primary CTA.
2. **Founder Profile**: Credentials, achievements, and testimonials (if available).
3. **Academy Overview**: Mission, vision, and Christian values.
4. **Courses**: Instrument offerings, levels, pricing, and curriculum highlights.
5. **The Annual Concert**: The ultimate goal and performance opportunity.
6. **Enrollment Form**: Direct student registration with instrument selection.
7. **Footer**: Contact information, social media links, and location (Goodlands).

### Design Decisions to Avoid

- ❌ Generic centered layouts
- ❌ Excessive rounded corners or uniform styling
- ❌ Purple gradients or clichéd "AI slop" patterns
- ❌ Placeholder images—use high-quality, custom visuals
- ❌ Overly complex animations—keep motion purposeful and subtle
